## ‚ú® Key Features

FantasyBot is designed to enhance your fantasy football experience with a suite of powerful, engaging, and unique features:

* üèÜ**Comprehensive League Insights:**
    * **Live Matchup Scores:** Get up-to-date fantasy team points for all weekly matchups using the `/matchups` command. *Note: This provides fantasy team point totals*
    * **League Information:** Instantly fetch detailed league standings, schedules, and scores.
    * **Leaderboards:** Showcase weekly and season leaders (MVP) and bottom performers (Chump). 
    * **Player Stats:** Get up-to-date player statistics directly in Discord.
    * **Transactions & Polls:** Automatically post league transactions and easily create polls for specific trades (e.g., to vote on "Collusion?").
    * **Weekly/Season Recaps:** Get visual recaps of your league's performance, including:
        * Podium-style bar graphs with Yahoo team images for ranking.
        * Bump charts showcasing team rankings over the regular season.
        * A season recap bar chart GIF for cumulative points collected.

* üìä**Advanced Player Valuation (Powered by FantasyCalc API):**
    * **Trade Evaluation:** Seamlessly compare players' trade values using `/trade_send`, `/trade_receive`, and `/trade_evaluate` commands, generating a bar chart for quick visual assessment.

* üì¢**Real-time News Feed (Rotowire RSS):**
    * Integrate Rotowire's RSS feed directly into a designated Discord channel for continuous fantasy news updates.

* üé≤**Engaging Wager System:**
    * **Slap Challenges:** Challenge another user's Yahoo team with a `/slap @discord_tag token_amount` command. At week's end, the fantasy points of both teams are compared, winner takes all!
    * **Matchup Wagering:** Bet your in-game tokens on any of the week's fantasy football matchups with `\wager`. If multiple users wager on the same winning team, the closest cumulative point prediction wins the pot.
